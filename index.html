                I am an aspiring developer, currently living in Padua (but open to relocate)
                and I'm 31 years old. <br /> <strong>I've always loved computers.</strong> My father used to work
                in a computer shop (Mr. Robot, anyone?) and since I was a child, I've always
                been surrounded by computers. I mostly used them to play videogames, but when
                I was old enough to start High School, <strong>I chose informatics</strong>, to take a step
                further into my passion. Unfortunately during High School I found out I'm not
                very good with mathematics and physics, so when the time came to choose a career
                path, I went to study Psychology at University of Padua. <br /> I started working
                in Human Resources in 2013, but something kept dragging me towards Informatics.
                In fact, in the year 2017 I moved to Padua as I was chosen to start up the
                North-Eastern Italy branch of <strong>Randstad Technologies</strong>, a division whose aim is to
                recruit IT professionals. The more I worked with them, spoke with them and got
                to know them, the more I understood that my place should have been on the other
                side of the fence. So here I am!

                <strong>Sitting in front of a computer is one of the things I love the most.</strong> Until
                now, though, my job has mostly been focused on keeping relations with different
                stalkeholders. <br /> In my professional future, I'd like to be able to match my
                capability in interacting with people with a wider knownledge in terms of <strong>technical
                skills.</strong> For this reason, I see myself in a role which has a lot of development
                stuff to do, as well as a direct contact with the client when it comes to gather
                requisitions and user expectations. <br /> I see myself as a good fit in both a big company
                or a small firm. <strong>I believe I could provide value in terms of soft skills</strong>, other
                than hard technical knownledge. In terms of technical expectations, in the future I'd like to
                focus more on web applications and software development. I'm not sure if I have enough
                aesthetic taste to work as a front-end developer ;)

                  <li>
                    Information technology is my passion. It has always been, and every inch of me
                    is craving for the opportunity to work in such an evolving sector. Computers
                    have been my best friend for a long period of my life, so I owe to them my
                    deepest consideration.

                  <li>
                    I'm a curious person. Curiosity towards human behaviour is what made me choose
                    psychology as a study path, but I'm also curious in terms of technology. I would
                    love a job that brings me to learning something new everyday, and I see this
                    Bootcamp as the perfect opportunity to put me on track for such a career.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I believe the Codemaster Bootcamp is the most interesting on the market,
                    both because of the study program, with React and Node being two of the best
                    technologies to currently work with, and also because of the international aspect
                    of Talent Garden, which I consider as a plus in terms of future opportunities.
