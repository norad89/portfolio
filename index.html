        I am an aspiring developer, currently living in Padua (but open to relocate) and I'm 31 years old. <br />
        <strong>I've always loved computers.</strong> My father used to work in a computer shop (Mr. Robot, anyone?) and
        since I was a child, I've always been surrounded by computers. I mostly used them to play videogames, but when I
        was old enough to start High School, <strong>I chose informatics</strong>, to take a step further into my
        passion. Unfortunately during High School I found out I'm not very good with mathematics and physics, so when
        the time came to choose a career path, I went to study Psychology at University of Padua. <br /> I started
        working in Human Resources in 2013, but something kept dragging me towards Informatics. In fact, in the year
        2017 I moved to Padua as I was chosen to start up the North-Eastern Italy branch of <strong>Randstad
          Technologies</strong>, a division whose aim is to recruit IT professionals. The more I worked with them, spoke
        with them and got to know them, the more I understood that my place should have been on the other side of the
        fence. So here I am!

        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Sitting in front of a computer is one of the things I love the most.</strong> Until now, though, my
          job has mostly been focused on keeping relations with different stalkeholders. <br /> In my professional
          future, I'd like to be able to match my capability in interacting with people with a wider knownledge in terms
          of <strong>technical skills.</strong> For this reason, I see myself in a role which has a lot of development
          stuff to do, as well as a direct contact with the client when it comes to gather requisitions and user
          expectations. <br /> I see myself as a good fit in both a big company or a small firm. <strong>I believe I
            could provide value in terms of soft skills</strong>, other than hard technical knownledge. In terms of
          technical expectations, in the future I'd like to focus more on web applications and software development. I'm
          not sure if I have enough aesthetic taste to work as a front-end developer ;)

      <div id="why">
        <h1>Why</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information technology is my passion. It has always been, and every inch of me is craving for the
            opportunity to work in such an evolving sector. Computers have been my best friend for a long period of my
            life, so I owe to them my deepest consideration.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm a curious person. Curiosity towards human behaviour is what made me choose psychology as a study path,
            but I'm also curious in terms of technology. I would love a job that brings me to learning something new
            everyday, and I see this Bootcamp as the perfect opportunity to put me on track for such a career.
          </li>
          <li>
            I believe the Codemaster Bootcamp is the most interesting on the market, both because of the study program,
            with React and Node being two of the best technologies to currently work with, and also because of the
            international aspect of Talent Garden, which I consider as a plus in terms of future opportunities.
